  * Cache transition probability matrices.
  * 4x faster tree summaries.
  * Discrete character data sets take 5x less RAM, and are 5x faster to load.

# RevBayes 1.2.0 "Lagerst√§tte" (Aug 3, 2022)

## New MCMC moves

 * slice sampling (mvSlice) can now do geometric scaling.

## New models/analyses

 * New codon models:
   * Goldman-Yang (1994), Muse-Gaut (1994), FMutSel (Yang 2008)
   * Create of Codon models using stackable blocks fndNdS, fnX3, fnMutSel, fnMutSelAA
   * i.e. fnMutSel( fndNdS( fnX3( fnGTR(er, pi), omega ), F ) # GTR + X3 + dNdS + MutSel
 * New dinucleotide models: fnX2, fnMutSel
   * i.e. fnMutSel( fnX2( fnHKY(kappa, nuc_pi) ), F )    # HKY + X2 + MutSel
 * New birth death models:
   * Birth death sampling treatment process (Magee et al. 2020)
   * Time-heterogeneous fossilized birth death range process
  
## New features

  * optional weighting in fnAverageDistanceMatrix
  * FBD range model uses individual fossil occurrence data
  * site mixture allocations work with codon models
  * automatic handling of whitespace delimited files

## Bug fixes

  * fixed occasional crashes when using recovering a tree from a checkpoint file due to rounding. Checkpointing now records doubles without rounding
  * fixed a bug when printing individual elements of average distance matrices and calculating their completeness


# RevBayes 1.1.1

## Changes

 * **Warning**: this version includes changes to the Random Number Generator, meaning analysis output will be different from v1.1.0, even when run with the same seed.

## New models/analyses

 * fixed a crash when printing the value of a rate matrix
 * fixed a crash when using nested clade constraints
 * fixed a crash when using DEC models
 * fixed an issue with using simplex indexes in deterministic nodes
 * fixed a bug allowing NodeTimeSlideUniform to move sampled ancestor nodes
