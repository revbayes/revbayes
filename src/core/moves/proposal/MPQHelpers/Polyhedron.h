        /**
         * This class is used to calculate the probability of proposing a non-reversible model from
         * a time reversible model for reversible jump MCMC. Proposing a non-reversible model from
         * a time reversible one involves the generation of three uniform(0,1) random variables,
         * u1, u2, and u3. The probability density would appear to be 1 X 1 X 1 = 1, but this is not
         * the case because there are constraints on the values that result in a valid non-reversible
         * model (e.g., one with all q_{ij} >= 0 (i != j). The constraints are (in Latex form),
         *
         * 0 \leq w_{AC} + w_{CG} (2 u_1 - 1) + w_{CT}(2 u_2 - 1) \leq 2 w_{AC}
         * 0 \leq w_{AG} - w_{CG} (2 u_1 - 1) + w_{GT}(2 u_3 - 1) \leq 2 w_{AG}
         * 0 \leq w_{AT} - w_{CT} (2 u_2 - 1) - w_{GT}(2 u_3 - 1) \leq 2 w_{AT}
         *
         * where w_{ij} = \pi_i q_{ij} is the average rate of changing from nucleotide i to j. The
         * class implements the constraints as planes (in 3D space) with the coordinates being (u1,u2,u3).
         * Six of the planes represent the bounds of the uniform(0,1) random variables (i.e., they
         * represent the unit cube). The other six planes represent the six constraints, above. The
         * planes for the unit cube never change and are initialized on instantiation of a Polyhedron
         * object. The other six planes (from the constraints, above) are initialized each time the
         * lnProbability* function is called. In fact, the lnProbability* functions take as a parameter
         * a vector of weights: w_{AC}, w_{AG}, w_{AT}, w_{CG}, w_{CT}, w_{GT}.
         *
         * The constraints form a polyhedron, with the details depending on the weights. The goal
         * is to calculate the volume of this polyhedron because the inverse of the volume is
         * the probability of proposing the non-reversible model from the time reversible model,
         * with the time reversible model being the point in the very center of the cube with
         * coordinates (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). All combinations of three of the 12 planes are checked
         * to see if they intersect (at a point, of course). If they do intersect, the intersecting
         * point is checked to see if it falls on the constraints described above. If the point
         * does satisfy the constraint, then it is a vertex in the polyhedron.
         *
         * After all of the vertices are found, they are organized into facets. The vertices for
         * a facet are ordered in clockwise fashion. This allows easy triangulation of each facet
         * to form tetrahedra (a polyhedron with four facets and four vertices). The tetrahedra
         * that compose the polyhedron are formed such that they all share the center point
         * (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Calculating the volume of a tetrahedron is pretty easy, just requiring
         * the calculation of the determinant of a matrix containing the vertices.
         *
         * All calculations are done with the GMP rational class. The GMP library is a high-
         * performance C/C++ library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. I think the rational
         * class from the GMP library uses two of the integer objects to represent the numerator
         * and denominator. Why do I use the GMP class at all? I do it to allow for exact
         * bounds checks and to avoid problems with threshold comparisons (which a normal implementation
         * using doubles would require). I took care to make certain that all of the key calculations
         * are always with rational numbers, never requiring the use of doubles or even
         * mpf_class (real number representation in the GMP library).
         *
         * Besides calculating the volume of the polyhedron, this class will also generate
         * random points from the polyhedron. The algorithm for doing this is pretty cool. You
         * can represent a point in a tetrahedron with vertices V1, V2, V3, and V4 as a mixture
         * of those four vertices:
         *
         * P = V1 * b1 + V2 * b2 + V3 * b3 + V4 * (1-s-t-u)b4
         *
         * Here, b1, b2, b3, and b4 are called the barycentric coordinates, with b1+b2+b3+b4=1.
         * You can generate a point uniformly and at random from a tetrahedron by generating
         * the barycentric coordinates from a Dirichlet(1, 1, 1, 1) probability distribution.
         * This code also allows you to bias the random point to be nearer to the center of
         * the cube (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Let's denote V1 as the center vertex with coordinates
         * (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Simply generate the barycentric coordinates from a
         * Dirichlet(alphaT, 1, 1, 1) distribution. If alphaT > 1, then the random points
         * will on average be closer to the center. The degree of clustering of the points
         * around the center will depend on the magnitude of alphaT. Interestingly, you could
         * bias the points to be nearer to the facets of the polyhedron than to the center by
         * setting alphaT less than 1. I don't know why you would want to do that, but there it is.
         *
         * Now that we know how to generate a random point from a tetrahedron, it's easy
         * to draw a point from the polyhedron. Simply pick a tetrahedron from the polyhedron
         * in proportion to its volume (compared to the volume of the polyhedron). Then, pick
         * a point from the tetrahedron, as described in the previous paragraph.
         *
         * This class can also calculate the probability of the random point. This was a rather
         * involved equation to derive, but it's pretty simple in the end. This works for the
         * uniform and biased ways of generating the random point.
         *
         * Again, the main way to interact with this class is through the functions
         * lnProbabilityForward and lnProbabilityReverse. Both functions take as input an
         * array of weights and a Vector (point). lnProbabilityForward generates a random
         * point from the polyhedron, initializing the point passed in as a reference to the
         * function as that random point, and returns the log probability density of that point.
         * The point for lnProbabilityReverse is assumed to be initialized. The code figures
         * out which tetrahedron the point resides in and returns the log probability
         * density of that point.
         *
         * The idea is that lnProbabilityForward is called elsewhere in the program when
         * one proposes a move from the time-reversible model to the non-reversible model.
         * The lnProbabilityReverse function is called when proposing a move from a non-reversible
         * model to a time reversible model, in which case we have to calculate the
         * probability of the imagined reverse move (from a time reversible to a non-reversible
         * model). This is why the lnProbabilityReverse function assumes the point that
         * is passed in as a function parameter is already initialized. The idea is the
         * point is initialized to represent the non-reversible model that one is moving from
         * when proposing the time reversible model.
         *
         * One more thing (really!). This class uses not only the GMP library, but implementations
         * of a Vector, Vertex, and Plane. Also, Vertex objects are managed by a singleton
         * class (called VertexFactory). The Vector, Vertex, and Plane classes all use GMP
         * rational numbers in their innards.
