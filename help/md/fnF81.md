## title
The Felsenstein (1981) nucleotide rate matrix
## description
DNA evolution model proposed in Felsenstein (1981).
## details
In this model, states are allowed to have different stationary frequencies, and transition rates between states are equal. Its only argument, baseFrequencies, codes for said stationary frequencies. While this is usually used for DNA (and therefore has four states), the function can take any number of states, and therefore be used for many other applications (such as aminoacid or morphological evolution).

## example
	# stationary base frequencies
	baseFrequencies ~ dnDirichlet(v(1,1,1,1))

	# create an F81 rate matrix
	Q := fnF81(baseFrequencies)
