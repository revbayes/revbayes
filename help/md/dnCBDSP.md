## title
Conditional birth-death shift process
## description
Simulates a tree under a birth-death process with shifts in birth and death rates through time.
## details
This distribution simulates a tree under a birth-death process. The initial 
birth and death rates can be specified with the rootLambda and rootMu arguments.
The rate at which speciation and extinction rate shifts take place is specified by the delta argument and the new speciation or extinction rate can be drawn from a prior distribution
specified in the lambda and mu arguments. 
Similar to other birth-death processes in RevBayes, you can specify the stopping condition
of the simulator (either survival or time) and the sampling probability.

## example
# set distributions for tree
root_age ~ dnUniform(0, 2)
root_lambda ~ dnUniform(0, 1)
root_mu ~ dnUniform(0, 1)
sampling_prob <- 1
# simulate tree
tree ~ dnCBDSP( rootAge           = root_age,
                rootLambda        = root_lambda,
                rootMu            = root_mu,
                delta             = .2,
                rho               = sampling_prob,
                condition         = "surival")
