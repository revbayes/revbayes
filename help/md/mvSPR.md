## title
Subtree Prune and Regraft (SPR) move.
## description
Tree topology move that performs a Subtree Prune and Regraft (SPR) on
an unrooted tree.
## details
`mvSPR` changes tree topology by cutting off a subtree and reattaching it
elsewhere in the original tree using the same subtree branch that was
originally cut. Every unrooted tree of n taxa has 2(n - 3)(2n - 7) SPR
"neighbors" that are one SPR move away (Allen & Steel 2001). This neighborhood
is larger than, and inclusive of, the neighborhood induced by Nearest-Neighbor
Interchange (`mvNNI`). As a result, `mvSPR` is more computationally demanding
than `mvNNI` and may exhibit lower acceptance rates, but explores a broader
range of different topologies and is less likely to get stuck in local optima.
The `mvSPR` move can be applied only to `BranchLengthTreee` objects.
An analogous move for `TimeTree` objects (Fixed Node-height Prune and Regraft;
FNPR) is implemented in `mvFNPR`.

## example
    taxa <- v(taxon("A"), taxon("B"), taxon("C"), taxon("D"), taxon("E"), taxon("F"))
    moves = VectorMoves()
    
    topology ~ dnUniformTopology(taxa)
    moves.append( mvSPR(topology, weight=taxa.size()) )
