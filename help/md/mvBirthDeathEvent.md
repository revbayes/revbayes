## name
mvBirthDeathEvent
## title
## description
This proposal randomly adds or removes a single character change event in a stochastic character map along a phylogenetic tree.
## details
This move adds or removes character change events along a tree. At each step, it randomly chooses to either add a new event (birth) on a branch or remove an existing event (death). The decision depends on how many events are currently in the tree. This move only works with character histories generated by birth-death models, and the exact way events are added or removed is handled by the specific model being used
