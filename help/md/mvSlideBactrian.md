## title
Bactrian Slide Move for MCMC 
## description
mvSlideBactrian is an MCMC move that proposes new values differently than the usual slide move
## details
This move adds a random increment to the current value. The increment is drawn from a Bactrian distribution, which is symmetric around the current value but has low density at the center, creating a bimodal shape. As a result, it is less likely to propose very small changes, encouraging larger moves. This improves mixing efficiency and helps reduce autocorrelation in the MCMC chain
