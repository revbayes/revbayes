## title
The Kimura (1980) nucleotide rate matrix
## description
DNA evolution model proposed in Kimura (1980).
## details
In this model, all nucleotides have an equal stationary frequency, and transition and transversion rates are allowed to be different. Its only parameter, kappa, codes for the ratio between the rate of transitions and transversions.

## example
	# the ratio between rates of transitions and transversions
	kappa ~ dnExp(0.5)

	# create a K80 rate matrix
	Q := fnK80(kappa)
