## name
Slice move
## title
Propose a slice move
## description
Instead of using a fixed move size, `mvSlice` determines the size of a move proposal based on the current shape of the likelihood function.
This allows small moves to be proposed in certain parts of parameter space,
and large moves in other parts of the space, as appropriate.
