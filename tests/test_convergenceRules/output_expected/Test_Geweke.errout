   
   Running MCMC simulation
   This simulation runs 4 independent replicates.
   The simulator uses 1 different moves in a random move schedule with 1 moves per iteration
   
   Stopping rule:
       Target value of the Geweke test statistic: > 0.0005 and < 0.9995
   
   
   Comparisons in which the Geweke test statistic is < 0.0005 or > 0.9995: 15/20 (target: 0/20)
   
   
   Comparisons in which the Geweke test statistic is < 0.0005 or > 0.9995: 3/20 (target: 0/20)
   
   
   Comparisons in which the Geweke test statistic is < 0.0005 or > 0.9995: 0/20 (target: 0/20)
