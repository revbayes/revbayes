Expected probability of a 6-taxon unrooted topology:
0.00952381

Actual probability of such a topology, drawn from dnUniformTopology():
0.00952381

Expected log probability of a 6-taxon unrooted topology:
-4.65396

Actual log probability of such a topology, drawn from dnUniformTopology():
-4.65396

Expected log probability density of a 6-taxon unrooted tree with all branches of length 0.1:
7.069305

Actual log probability density of such a tree, drawn from dnUniformTopologyBranchLength():
7.069305
